UPCOMING [4.1.0]
- Integrated the scene2d `Actions` to allow more customizable animations than what the `AnimatedPieMenu` and `AnimatedPieWidget` offered.
- Added a Testing Menu so that Contributors can more easily test their implementations.
- Updated `ShapeDrawer` version to `v2.1.0`.

[4.0.0]
- A `Batch` does not need to be passed to the constructors anymore.
- Introduced `PieWidget` in the new design: the `RadialGroup` now doesn't deal in any way with the `ShapeDrawer`.
- `getMaxDiameter` has been renamed to `getCurrentDiameter`.
- `getMaxRadius` has been renamed to `getCurrentRadius`.
- `minRadius` has been renamed to `preferredRadius`.
- Introduced a new `individuals` demo (named "RadialButtons") to showcase the new `RadialGroup` class.
- Changed the way the scene2d `hit` method works with the widget.
- Fixed the `hit` for when a contained Actor extends beyond the limits of the widget itself.
- Fixed `RadialGroup` containing other `PieMenu`.
- Fixed non-regular width and height values on Animated widgets.
- Fixed `centerOnActor` method used on an Actor that was contained within a `Group`.

[3.1.0]
- Fixed the "floating" `Group` that contained `RadialGroup`.
- More efficient evaluation for the reset of the hover on mouse-exit.
- The `background` image can now be a `Drawable` as well (but keep in mind that `Drawable` cannot be rotated).

[3.0.0]
- Hotfix for `rotateBy()`.
- Hotfix for overlapping menus.
- Updated `ShapeDrawer` to v2.0.3 (fixes some crashes).
- Shorter way of integrating the library for GWT.
- Renamed `PieMenuClickListener` to `PieMenuListener`.

[3.0.0-rc2]
- Introduced a new behavior-flag: `middleCancel` determines if releasing a click from within the inner-radius will trigger the extended selection or the `defaultIndex` selection.
- `ChildRegion` is now referred to as `Slice` throughout the API.
- Style variables now have shorter names that resemble the `ButtonStyle` naming.
- `setDefaultIndex` now changes the `selectedIndex` if it isn't a valid index.
- The complementary callbacks (highlight and hover) are now regrouped within `PieMenuCallbacks`.
- Integrated rotations: scene2d's `rotateBy()` method is now supported.
- `radius` has been renamed to `minRadius` since it is now a suggested radius for the minimal radius value. In case `setFillParent(true)` or other size-changing methods are used (Table's `fill`, for example), the widget will now expand as a scene2d user would expect it to.
- `innerRadius` now designates a percentage of the radius, instead of an amount of pixels.
- Fixed the flicker resulting from hovering out of a contained Actor.
- `selectedColor` now used by default if no `downColor` was set: this is to prevent a flicker when clicking.
- Fixed a few `Animated` constructors.
- The `ShapeDrawer` is now instantiated internally.
- The default rules used by `ShapeDrawer` to determine the amount of sides to draw is now internally overridden with an improved algorithm.
- Added an example for adding Keyboard-Key-Mapping (selection through keyboard) on a `PieMenu`.

[3.0.0-rc1]
- Refactored the Style so that most of the `float` values (`radius` and the likes) have become class-attributes instead.
- Many more constructors available. Basic `float` properties (`radius` and the likes) are now integrated in the constructors.
- `PieMenuSuggestedClickListener` renamed to `PieMenuClickListener` and is now added by default. A setter is provided to change this `ClickListener` to a custom one.
- Added callbacks for mouse-over. Added the corresponding `hoveredChildRegionColor` and `hoveredAndSelectedChildRegionColor` to the `PieMenuStyle`.
- Added `highlightedChildRegionColor` in the `PieMenuStyle`.
- The `PieMenuClickListener` now triggers a highlight on `touchDown` rather than waiting for the mouse to move after the initial click.
- `HighlightChangeListener` renamed to `PieMenuHighlightChangeListener` and now extends EventListener. Removed the associated getter and setter: now `addListener()` should be used for that too.
- Widgets now start with their visibility set to `true` (it used to be `false`): this is to remain closer to scene2d's expected behavior.
- Changed the Actor-sizing algorithm (and thus fixed it for low `innerRadius` values).
- Integrated the propagation of the alpha from parent to children. Use the `setGlobalAlphaMultiplier(float)` method to do so.
- Fix for Widgets contained within a Table.
- Fix of the PieMenuStyle Colors-duplication.
- Style's `Circumference` values now include the `innerRadius` value.
- New API methods to allow more customization: `getActorDistanceFromCenter`, `getEstimatedRadiusAt`  and `modifyActor` can be changed to be whatever you want.
- Removed from the API the `@Deprecated` methods which should have been implemented by the users themselves anyway. This is reflected in the corresponding code-examples.

[2.2.0]
- Animated versions of the implementations are now available!

[2.1.0]
- Added a `defaultIndex` flag as a fallback value when an invalid index is being selected.
- Minor fix on the `PieMenu`'s `hit` method.

[2.0.0]
- The default of `infiniteSelectionRange` is now `false`.
- Removed the PieMenu.SuggestedClickListener inner class and made it its own class: `PieMenuSuggestedClickListener`.
- Removed the `manualVisibility` flag: it wasn't consistent enough and forced users to learn or guess about some internal workings.
- Removed the `highlightIsSelection` flag: it complexified the API despite there being the Highlight callback.
- Fixed a bug with the `selectIndex(int)` method.
- Preparing HTML-GWT set up.
- Multisampling from the DesktopLauncher for smoother recordings.

[1.0.0]
- Image child-Actors are now properly sized to remain within their sector.
- All of the examples are separated in different test classes for easy copy-paste.
- Even more API methods available to the public.
- Finished writing the JavaDoc.

[0.2.1-alpha]
- Refactoring the project's structure to resemble to other usual libGDX libraries.
- Opening up the API (more public methods accessible to users of the library).
- Including ShapeDrawer as a dependency by-default.

[0.1.1-alpha]
- JitPack deployment properly integrated.

[0.1.0-alpha]
- Initial code
- 5 different types of PieMenu are integrated and demonstrated.
